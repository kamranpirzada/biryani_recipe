    <h1>pulao recipe</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Beef pulao is a mildly spiced, aromatic rice dish made by cooking beef and basmati rice together in a
            flavorful stock. To prepare it, start by heating oil or ghee in a large pot and adding whole spices such as
            bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, peppercorns, and cinnamon to release their aroma. </li>
        <li>Add thinly sliced onions and
            sauté until they turn golden brown, then mix in ginger–garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears.
            Add beef pieces, salt, and green chilies, and sauté until the meat is well coated with the spices. Pour in
            enough water to cover the meat and let it simmer until the beef turns tender and forms a rich, flavorful
            broth. </li>
        <li>Once the beef is cooked, rinse and soak basmati rice for 20–30 minutes, then add it to the pot along
            with the required amount of stock </li>
        <li>(usually the stock should be about an inch above the rice). Adjust salt as
            needed and bring everything to a gentle boil.</li>
        <li> Lower the heat, cover the pot, and allow it to cook on dum
            until the rice is fluffy and the grains are separate. Finally, fluff the pulao lightly with a fork and serve
            hot with raita, salad, or chutney for a comforting and satisfying meal.</li>
