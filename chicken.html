    <ol>
        <li>Chicken biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish made by layering partially cooked basmati rice with
            marinated chicken and aromatic spices. To prepare it, start by marinating chicken pieces in a mixture of
            yogurt, ginger–garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, and a little lemon juice; let
            it rest for at least 30 minutes</li>
        <li> for deeper flavor. Meanwhile, rinse and soak basmati rice for about 20–30
            minutes.</li>
        <li> Heat oil or ghee in a large pot, add whole spices like bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, and
            star anise, then sauté sliced onions until golden brown. Add tomatoes, green chilies, and fresh
            cilantro–mint leaves, cooking until soft, then add the marinated chicken and cook until it turns tender and
            releases its juices. In another pot, par-boil the soaked rice with salt until it’s about 70% cooked, then
            drain.</li>
        <li> Begin layering by placing the chicken mixture at the bottom of a heavy pot, covering it with the
            semi-cooked rice. Sprinkle saffron-soaked milk or a bit of food coloring, along with fried onions and more
            herbs,</li>
        <li> over the top. Seal the pot with a tight lid and cook on low heat (dum) for about 20–25 minutes so the
            flavors blend beautifully. Once done, gently fluff the biryani and serve hot with raita, salad, or boiled
            eggs.</li>
