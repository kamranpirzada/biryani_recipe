    <h1>beef biryani recipe</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Beef biryani is a rich, hearty, and aromatic dish made by combining tender beef pieces with fragrant basmati
            rice and a blend of traditional spices. To prepare it, start by marinating the beef in yogurt, ginger–garlic
            paste, turmeric, red chili powder, biryani masala, salt, and a little lemon juice; allow it to rest for </li>
        <li>at
            least an hour so the flavors penetrate the meat. Heat oil or ghee in a heavy pot, add whole spices such as
            bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, and star anise, then sauté thinly sliced onions until they turn deep
            golden brown. Add tomatoes, green chilies, and chopped mint–cilantro, cooking until soft and fragrant. Add
            the marinated beef and cook slowly </li>
        <li>until the meat becomes tender; you may need to add a little water and let
            it simmer for a while depending on the cut of beef. In the meantime, rinse and soak basmati rice for about
            20–30 minutes,</li>
        <li> then par-boil it with salt until it’s around 70% cooked and strain it. For layering, place
            the cooked beef gravy at the bottom of a heavy-bottomed pot and spread the semi-cooked rice evenly on top.
            Drizzle </li>
        <li>saffron-infused milk or a touch of yellow food color over the rice, then add fried onions and fresh
            herbs for extra aroma. Seal the pot tightly and cook on low heat (dum) for 25–30 minutes, allowing the rice
            to finish cooking and absorb all the flavors. Once done, fluff gently and serve hot with raita, salad, or
            pickles.</li>
